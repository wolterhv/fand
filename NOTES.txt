Controller
----------

The controller can be a simple PID controller.

Output: fan PWM duty cycle
Input:  CPU temperature (filtered, see ยง Input filter).

The input shall be sampled at 0,20 Hz. The output may be updated with the same
frequency.


Input filter
------------

First-order low pass filter will be used, with discrete transfer function

                b
    H(z) = ------------ ,
           1 - a z^(-1)

which is implemented in the discrete time domain via the following equation:

    y_filt[n] = (1-g)*y_filt[n-1] + g*y_raw[n] ,

where 

    y_raw[n]     is the current input value,
    y_filt[n-1]     the previous output value, and 
    y_filt[n]       the current output value, 

g, a and b are related by the following equations

    b = g
    a = 1 - g .

According to data analysis, a g = 0.125 is adequate for filtering the
temperature signal.


Hysteresis
----------

Option 1: Minimal significant PWM DC
 +
Option 2: Temperature limits
 + Easier to interpret
 - Needs calculations or reconfiguration to make DC start out smooth


Tuning
